# Australian International Trade Analysis (1988–2024)
## Data Visualization & Visual Analytics Project

This repository contains a complete analytical project exploring **36 years of Australian international trade data** using **Excel** and **Tableau**. The analysis focuses on identifying structural trade imbalances, visualizing trends, and forecasting future trade patterns - with a deep dive into **Road Vehicles (subcategory 7.8)** under **Machinery & Transport Equipment (Category 7)**.

---

## Project Overview

### Objective
To analyze over three decades of Australian trade data, uncover key patterns, visualize structural imbalances, and forecast future trends using **statistical, analytical, and interactive visual storytelling techniques**.

### Key Questions Explored
1. How has Australia’s trade composition evolved since 1988?
2. Which categories dominate imports and exports?
3. Why is **Category 7 (Machinery & Transport)** so significant?
4. What role does **Road Vehicles (7.8)** play in Australia’s trade deficit?
5. What can we forecast for the next 5 years (2025–2029)?

## Key Insights

### 1. Structural Trade Imbalance
- **Imports**: Dominated by **Machinery & Transport (Category 7)**, consistently 30–45% of total imports.
- **Exports**: Dominated by **Mineral Fuels (Category 3)** and **Crude Materials (Category 2)**, together ~68% of exports in 2024.
- **Result**: Australia exports commodities and imports manufactured goods — a persistent economic structure.

### 2. Road Vehicles (7.8) — The Deficit Driver
- Largest import subcategory within Category 7 (~42% share in 2024).
- **Trade deficit ratio of 20:1** (imports vs. exports).
- Grew **1,283% in absolute value** from 1988 to 2024.
- Peaked in relative share in the mid-2000s, then declined as other subcategories grew faster.

### 3. Crisis & Recovery Patterns
- **2009 GFC**: Sharp contraction, strong rebound.
- **2020 COVID-19**: Moderate dip, rapid recovery — trade proved resilient.
- Road Vehicles were hit harder during crises compared to overall trade.

### 4. 5-Year Forecast (2025–2029)
- **Imports**: Expected to grow steadily (~4% annually), reaching ~$41B by 2029.
- **Exports**: Stagnant, with mild recovery and high uncertainty.
- **AI vs. Tableau Forecast**: AI predicts more conservative growth, accounting for market saturation and economic headwinds.

## Methodology

### 1. Data Preparation (Excel)
- Transformed raw ABS data into:
  - **Statistical patterns** (percentage of total trade)
  - **Analytical patterns** (year-over-year growth ratios)
- Verified calculations for consistency and accuracy.

### 2. Visualization (Tableau)
- Created **12+ interactive charts** and **5 dashboards**:
  - Import-Export trends over time
  - Category/subcategory composition
  - Growth rate volatility
  - Treemaps, diverging bars, box plots, triple-axis charts
  - Ranking evolution and forecasting models

### 3. Storytelling & Presentation
- Built a **Tableau Storyboard** to guide viewers through key insights.
- Optimized captions, highlights, and timing for clarity and impact.
- Tested narrative flow with non-technical users for comprehension.

### 4. Forecasting Comparison
- **Manual forecast** using Tableau’s built-in model.
- **AI-generated forecast** using historical data (2015–2024) and trend analysis.
- Compared outcomes to evaluate methodology strengths and limitations.

## Recommendations for Policy & Industry

1. **Targeted EV Battery Assembly**: Could capture $9.5-19B over 5 years with strategic investment.
2. **Leverage Vehicle Imports in Trade Negotiations**: Use Australia’s $34B annual vehicle market to improve agricultural export terms.
3. **Accelerate EV Transition**: Could reduce import values by $6-8B annually by 2029 due to lower EV costs.
